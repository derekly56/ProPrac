# ProPrac (Programming Practice)
--------------------
### **Author:**
- Derek L.

### **Disclaimer**
If you are going through the github, I have not completed both books, as this
will take time for me to finish coding each problem and attempt at them. I will
try my best to finish **Cracking The Coding Interview** first. However, I do
apologize if anyone is trying to find a particular solution that I have not
attempted/finished. Thanks for everyones support!

### **Purpose:**
- The purpose of this folder is to store problems and MY solutions to  
the following book problems for programming interviews
- You're more than welcome to check out my solutions to what I have!
- Good luck to everyone out there with programming practices/interviews
